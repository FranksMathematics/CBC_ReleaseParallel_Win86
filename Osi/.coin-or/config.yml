  LongDescription: |2
    "The COIN-OR Open Solver Interface is a uniform API for interacting
    with callable solver libraries.
    It supports linear programming solvers as well as the ability to \"finish off\"
    a mixed-integer problem calling the solver library\'s MIP solver.
    A list of supported solvers appears at the bottom of the page."
